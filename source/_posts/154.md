# [154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

<!-- more -->

The array may contain duplicates.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

- This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
- Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## Idea

It's a hard version of problem [153](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/) with duplicates. Here we use three values, `left`, `mid` and `right`. If `left` is greater than `mid`, then the *minimum* locates in `(left, mid]` and thus we let `left` auto-increase by 1 and assign the value of `mid` to `right`. If `left` ≤ `mid` and `mid` > `right`, certainly minimum locates in `(mid, right]`. Under the situation that `left` ≤ `mid` <= `right`, if `left` < `right`, then the minimum is `left` for that there's only one pivot and if `left` == `right`, then we can't determine whether minimum locates in `(left, mid]` or `(mid, right]`, thus simply let `right` auto-decrease by 1 and do the processes again.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int length = nums.size();
        if (length < 0) {
            return -1;
        } else if (length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        } else if (length == 2) {
            return min(nums[0], nums[1]);
        }
        
        int left = 0, right = length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[left] > nums[mid]) {
                left++;
                right = mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                if (nums[left] < nums[right]) {
                    return nums[left];
                } else {
                    right--;
                }
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
};
```
